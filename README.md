# MetaClaude

A cognitive framework for building self-aware, adaptive AI systems. MetaClaude provides reusable patterns, orchestration capabilities, and cognitive architectures that can be applied to any domain.

## What is MetaClaude?

MetaClaude is a meta-cognitive layer for Claude that enables:

- **Self-Evolving Intelligence**: Systems that create new reasoning patterns when facing unprecedented challenges
- **Transparent Reasoning**: Explainable decision-making with clear cognitive traces
- **Adaptive Behavior**: Context-aware responses that adjust to situational needs
- **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Coordinated specialist agents working in parallel
- **Cognitive Persistence**: Learning and memory that evolves across sessions

## Core Components

### Cognitive Patterns
Reusable reasoning frameworks that can be applied across domains:
- **Reasoning Patterns**: Analytical, creative, strategic, and adaptive thinking modes
- **Memory Operations**: Simulated persistence and knowledge accumulation
- **Feedback Processing**: Learning mechanisms and improvement cycles
- **Pattern Lifecycle**: Dynamic pattern creation, evolution, and retirement

### Orchestration Layer
Coordination and workflow management:
- **Agent Coordination**: Multi-specialist collaboration
- **Workflow Dispatch**: Complex task decomposition and execution
- **Parallel Processing**: Efficient concurrent operations
- **Result Synthesis**: Intelligent aggregation of outputs

### Evolution Layer
Self-improvement and adaptation:
- **Dynamic Reasoning Selection**: Choose or create appropriate patterns
- **Autonomous Learning**: Extract insights from interactions
- **Conflict Resolution**: Handle contradictions and ambiguities
- **Explainable AI**: Transparent decision processes

## Available Implementations

### UI Designer
A comprehensive UI/UX design assistant featuring:
- 6 specialized design agents
- Vibe design methodology

## Quick Start

### Using an Implementation

```bash
# Install MetaClaude
./install.sh

# Use the UI Designer implementation
"I want to create a modern SaaS dashboard using the UI Designer implementation"
```

### Creating Your Own Implementation

1. **Define Your Domain**
   - Identify specialist roles needed
   - Map workflow patterns
   - Define success criteria

2. **Create Specialists**
   ```

   │   ├── specialist-1.md
   │   ├── specialist-2.md
   │   └── orchestrator.md
   ├── workflows/
   │   └── main-workflow.md
   └── README.md
   ```

3. **Leverage Core Patterns**
   - Import reasoning patterns
   - Use memory operations
   - Apply feedback loops
