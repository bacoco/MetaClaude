- ✅ **Automatic peer review** - Gemini validates everything

## 💡 How It Works: Prose-as-Code Magic

Traditional AI hides its logic. MetaClaude's logic is **written in plain English**:

```markdown
# This markdown IS the AI's brain:

## When user asks for a dashboard:
1. Check memory for their style preferences
2. Analyze their business domain  
3. Generate 3 variants:
   - Minimal for startups
   - Data-rich for analytics
   - Executive for C-suite
4. Apply their brand colors automatically
```

**This isn't documentation. This IS the executing code.** You can read it, modify it, extend it.
