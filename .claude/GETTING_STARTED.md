# Getting Started with MetaClaude

## What is MetaClaude?

MetaClaude is a cognitive framework that enhances Claude with:
- Self-aware reasoning patterns
- Multi-agent orchestration
- Adaptive learning capabilities
- Domain-specific implementations

## Quick Start

### Using the UI Designer Implementation

The UI Designer is currently the primary implementation available. To use it:

```
"I want to create a modern dashboard design using the UI Designer implementation"
```

Or simply:

```
"Design a mobile app for task management"
```

MetaClaude will automatically engage the UI Designer implementation.

### Key Commands

#### Design Workflows
- `"Run a design sprint for [product]"` - 5-day rapid design process
- `"Create a complete UI project for [product]"` - Full 7-week process
- `"Generate an MVP design for [idea]"` - Quick 72-hour MVP

#### Specific Tasks
- `"Extract design DNA from [inspiration source]"` - Analyze visual patterns
- `"Create UI variations for [screen/feature]"` - Generate multiple options
- `"Audit accessibility for [design]"` - Check WCAG compliance
- `"Develop brand identity for [company]"` - Complete brand strategy

## Understanding the Architecture

### Cognitive Patterns
MetaClaude uses reusable thinking patterns:
- **Analytical**: Breaking down complex problems
- **Creative**: Generating innovative solutions
- **Strategic**: Long-term planning
- **Adaptive**: Context-aware responses

### Agent Orchestration
Specialized agents work together:
- **Orchestrator**: Coordinates all activities
- **Specialists**: Domain experts (6 for UI Designer)
- **Parallel Processing**: Multiple agents work simultaneously
- **Result Synthesis**: Intelligent combination of outputs

## Best Practices

### 1. Be Specific About Context
```
Good: "Design a fitness app for seniors with large touch targets and high contrast"
Better: "Design a fitness tracking app for adults 65+ with mobility limitations, focusing on simple daily exercises, medication reminders, and emergency contacts"
```

### 2. Leverage Workflows
Instead of asking for individual tasks, use complete workflows:
```
"Run a design sprint for a meal planning app that reduces food waste"
```

### 3. Iterate Based on Feedback
MetaClaude learns from your feedback:
```
"The designs look good but need more whitespace and larger fonts"
```

### 4. Use Natural Language
No need for special syntax - just describe what you want:
```
"I need a modern, minimalist design for a meditation app with calming colors"
```

## Common Use Cases

### Startup MVP
```
"Create an MVP design for a B2B SaaS platform that helps small businesses manage inventory"
```

### Redesign Project
```
"Modernize the UI for a legacy financial dashboard while maintaining familiarity for existing users"
```

### Design System
```
"Create a complete design system for a healthcare startup focused on telemedicine"
```

### Brand Development
```
"Develop a brand identity for an eco-friendly fashion brand targeting millennials"
```

## Advanced Features

### Memory and Learning
MetaClaude remembers context within sessions:
- Design decisions persist
- Patterns are recognized
- Preferences are learned

### Parallel Generation
Request multiple variations:
```
"Create 5 different homepage designs with varying levels of visual complexity"
```

### Cross-Functional Integration
Combine different specialties:
```
"Design a dashboard that balances data density (UX) with brand personality (Brand) and accessibility (A11y)"
```

## Troubleshooting

### If results aren't what you expected:
1. Provide more context about your goals
2. Specify any constraints or requirements
3. Share examples of what you like/dislike
4. Ask for specific adjustments

### If the process seems slow:
- Break down complex requests into phases
- Use predefined workflows when possible
- Focus on one major goal at a time

## Next Steps

1. **Try a Simple Task**: Start with extracting design DNA from an image
2. **Run a Workflow**: Try a design sprint for a simple app idea
3. **Explore Specialties**: Ask specific agents for their expertise
4. **Build Something Real**: Create a complete design system

## Need Help?

Ask MetaClaude:
```
"What can you help me design?"
"Explain how the design process works"
"Show me examples of what you can create"
```

MetaClaude is designed to be intuitive - just describe what you need and let the cognitive framework handle the complexity.
