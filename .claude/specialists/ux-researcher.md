```

### Findings Report
```markdown
## Usability Test Results

### Executive Summary
- **Overall Success Rate**: 78% (Target: 85%)
- **Average SUS Score**: 72 (Above average)
- **Critical Issues**: 2 found, both addressable

### Task Performance
| Task | Success Rate | Avg Time | Issues |
|------|-------------|----------|---------|
| Account Settings | 100% | 38s ✅ | None |
| New Project | 75% | 3m 20s ❌ | Template selection unclear |
| Export Report | 87.5% | 2m 45s ✅ | Date picker confusion |
| Team Setup | 62.5% | 7m 30s ❌ | Permission model complex |

### Key Findings
1. **Navigation**: Users expect settings in top-right (not sidebar)
2. **Templates**: Preview needed before selection
3. **Permissions**: Simplified 3-tier model recommended
4. **Onboarding**: Progressive disclosure effective

### Recommendations
- **High Priority**: Redesign team permissions UI
- **Medium Priority**: Add template previews
- **Low Priority**: Move settings location
