# Generate MVP Concept Command

Structure comprehensive app concepts with elevator pitches, core features, and user flows for rapid MVP development.

## Command Usage
```bash
clause --project UIDesignOrchestrator/project:generate-mvp-concept "app description"
```

## Process Flow

### 1. Concept Crystallization
```yaml
mvp_definition:
  elevator_pitch: |
    [Product Name] helps [target users] achieve [core value]
    by [unique approach] unlike [alternatives].
    
  example: |
    TaskFlow helps busy professionals manage their workload
    by using AI to automatically prioritize and schedule tasks
    unlike traditional to-do apps that require manual organization.
    
  constraints:
    - Maximum 25 words
    - Clear value proposition
    - Specific target audience
    - Unique differentiator
```

### 2. Feature Prioritization
```javascript
const mvpFeatures = {
  core: {
    // Absolutely essential for MVP
    priority: "P0",
    features: [
      {
        name: "User Authentication",
        description: "Secure sign-up/login with email",
        effort: "S",
        impact: "Critical"
      },
      {
        name: "Core Workflow",
        description: "Primary value-delivering functionality",
        effort: "L",
        impact: "Critical"
      },
      {
        name: "Basic Dashboard",
        description: "Central hub for user actions",
        effort: "M",
        impact: "Critical"
      }
    ]
  },
  
  nice_to_have: {
    // Enhance experience but not critical
    priority: "P1",
    features: [
      {
        name: "Advanced Filters",
        description: "Refined data viewing options",
        effort: "M",
        impact: "High"
      },
      {
        name: "Integrations",
        description: "Third-party service connections",
        effort: "L",
        impact: "Medium"
      }
    ]
  },
  
  future: {
    // Post-MVP roadmap
    priority: "P2",
    features: [
      {
        name: "AI Recommendations",
        description: "Smart suggestions based on usage",
        effort: "XL",
        impact: "High"
      }
    ]
  }
};
```

### 3. User Flow Mapping
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Landing Page] --> B{New User?}
    B -->|Yes| C[Sign Up]
    B -->|No| D[Sign In]
    C --> E[Onboarding]
    D --> F[Dashboard]
    E --> F
    F --> G[Core Action 1]
    F --> H[Core Action 2]
    F --> I[Settings]
    G --> J[Success State]
    H --> J
    J --> F
```

### 4. Screen Inventory
```javascript
const screenMap = {
  marketing: {
    landing: {
      purpose: "Convert visitors to users",
      elements: ["Hero", "Features", "Testimonials", "CTA"],
      conversion_points: 3
    },
    pricing: {
      purpose: "Clear value communication",
      elements: ["Plan comparison", "FAQs", "Guarantee"],
      conversion_points: 2
    }
  },
  
  authentication: {
    signup: {
      fields: ["Email", "Password", "Name"],
      validations: ["Email format", "Password strength"],
      social_options: ["Google", "GitHub"]
    },
    signin: {
      fields: ["Email", "Password"],
      features: ["Remember me", "Forgot password"],
      security: "2FA optional"
    }
  },
  
  application: {
    dashboard: {
      widgets: ["Stats overview", "Recent activity", "Quick actions"],
      personalization: "User preference based",
      refresh_rate: "Real-time"
    },
    core_feature: {
      layout: "Focus on primary action",
      guidance: "Inline help and tooltips",
      states: ["Empty", "Loading", "Active", "Error"]
    }
  }
};
```

### 5. Technical Considerations

## Tool Integration

| Step | Action | Tool to Use | Purpose |
|------|--------|-------------|----------|
| 1. Research domain | Understand context | `search_file_content("similar")` | Find existing patterns |
| 2. Generate concept | Create MVP structure | None (internal) | Build concept model |
| 3. Present concept | Show in response | None | Display MVP definition |
| 4. Save concept | Store definition | `write_file("mvp-concept.json")` (if requested) | Persist concept |
| 5. Create roadmap | Generate timeline | `write_file("roadmap.md")` (if requested) | Project planning |
| 6. Init structure | Create folders | `run_shell_command("mkdir -p")` | Setup project |

### Tool Usage Examples
```javascript
// Step 1: Research existing patterns
const existingProjects = search_file_content("dashboard", "src/");
const hasimilarFeatures = analyzeSimilarProjects(existingProjects);

// Step 2-3: Generate and present concept
const mvpConcept = generateMVPConcept({
  description: userDescription,
  existingPatterns: similarFeatures,
  constraints: projectConstraints
});
presentMVPConcept(mvpConcept);

// Step 4: Save concept definition
if (userWantsSave) {
  write_file("project/mvp-concept.json", JSON.stringify(mvpConcept, null, 2));
  write_file("project/mvp-summary.md", generateConceptSummary(mvpConcept));
}

// Step 6: Initialize project structure
if (userWantsInit) {
  run_shell_command("mkdir -p src/components src/screens src/services");
  write_file("src/screens/index.js", generateScreenIndex(mvpConcept.screens));
}
```

### Complexity Levels
```yaml
mvp_complexity:
  simple:
    screens: 5-10
    features: 3-5
    timeline: 4-6 weeks
    
  moderate:
    screens: 10-20
    features: 5-10
