# Complete UI Project Workflow

End-to-end UI/UX design project workflow from initial concept to final deliverables, orchestrating all specialists and commands.

## Workflow Overview

```
RESEARCH → CONCEPT → DESIGN → ITERATE → DELIVER
```

## Project Initialization

```javascript
const initializeProject = {
  input: {
    projectName: 'string',
    projectType: 'web|mobile|desktop',
    description: 'string',
    timeline: 'weeks',
    constraints: ['budget', 'technical', 'brand']
  },
  
  setup: async (input) => {
    // Create project structure
    const project = {
      id: generateProjectId(),
      ...input,
      status: 'active',
      phase: 'research',
      team: assignSpecialists(input),
      memory: initializeMemory(input)
    };
    
    // Store in memory with context scoping
    await memory.store(`project_${project.id}`, project, 'project');
    
    // Generate project setup explanation
    const explanation = explainableAI.generateProjectRationale({
      projectType: input.projectType,
      constraints: input.constraints,

    // Find conflicts using enhanced conflict detection
    const conflicts = conflictResolver.identifyFeedbackConflicts(
      stakeholderFeedback, 
      userFeedback
    );
    
    // Apply contextual learning to understand patterns
    const contextualInsights = contextualLearning.analyzeFeedbackContext({
      stakeholder: stakeholderFeedback,
