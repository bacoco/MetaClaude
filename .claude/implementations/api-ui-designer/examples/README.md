# API UI Designer Examples

This directory contains comprehensive examples demonstrating how the API UI Designer transforms various API specifications into fully-functional user interfaces.

## Examples Overview

### 1. [Petstore Example](./petstore-example/README.md)
**Classic OpenAPI/REST Example**
- Simple CRUD operations for pet management
- Demonstrates basic form generation and list views
- Shows error handling and loading states
- Perfect starting point for REST API UI generation

**Key Features Demonstrated:**
- Auto-generated list views with filtering
- Form generation from OpenAPI schemas
- Image upload handling
- Status workflows
- Basic pagination

### 2. [E-Commerce REST API Example](./rest-api-example/README.md)
**Complex REST API with Relationships**
- Multi-resource e-commerce platform
- Nested resources (orders → items, users → addresses)
- Advanced filtering and pagination
- Shopping cart and checkout flows

**Key Features Demonstrated:**
- Complex filter UI generation
- Nested resource management
- Real-time inventory updates
- Pagination strategies
- Mobile-responsive layouts

### 3. [Social Media GraphQL Example](./graphql-example/README.md)
**Real-time GraphQL with Subscriptions**
- Social media platform with posts, comments, likes
- GraphQL query builder UI
- Real-time updates via subscriptions
- Optimistic UI updates

**Key Features Demonstrated:**
- Visual query builder generation
- Subscription handling
- Optimistic updates
- Complex caching strategies
- Real-time collaboration features

## Common Patterns Across Examples

### 1. **Component Generation**
All examples demonstrate automatic generation of:
- List/grid views with filtering
- Detail views with actions
- Forms with validation
- Error and loading states
- Navigation components

### 2. **State Management**
- Automatic store generation
- Cache management
- Optimistic updates
- Real-time synchronization

### 3. **Developer Experience**
- Type-safe generated code
- Customization hooks
- Theme integration
- Performance optimizations

### 4. **User Experience**
- Consistent error handling
- Loading states
- Accessibility features
- Mobile responsiveness

## Quick Comparison

| Feature | Petstore | E-Commerce | Social Media |
|---------|----------|------------|--------------|
| API Type | REST/OpenAPI | REST/OpenAPI | GraphQL |
| Complexity | Basic | Advanced | Complex |
| Real-time | No | Partial | Full |
| Relationships | Simple | Nested | Graph |
| Best For | Simple CRUD | E-commerce/Marketplace | Social/Collaborative |

## Getting Started

1. **Choose an example** that matches your API type
2. **Review the API specification** to understand the input
3. **Examine the generated components** to see the output
4. **Study the user flows** to understand the UX
5. **Learn from the lessons** to avoid common pitfalls

## Key Takeaways

### From Petstore Example:
- Simple schemas can generate rich UIs
- Error states are crucial for good UX
- Form generation should handle all field types
- Loading patterns improve perceived performance

### From E-Commerce Example:
- Complex filters need thoughtful UI design
- Pagination strategies affect performance
- Nested resources require careful state management
- Mobile-first design is essential

### From GraphQL Example:
- Query builders can simplify GraphQL adoption
- Real-time features need optimistic updates
- Subscription management is complex but powerful
- Caching strategies are critical for performance
