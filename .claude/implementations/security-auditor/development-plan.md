  - Incident response procedures

## Success Metrics

1. **Detection Accuracy**
   - < 5% false positive rate
   - < 1% false negative rate for critical vulnerabilities
   - 95%+ coverage of OWASP Top 10

2. **Performance**
   - < 5 minutes for basic code scan
   - < 30 minutes for comprehensive security audit
   - Ability to handle codebases > 1M LOC

3. **Remediation Quality**
   - 90%+ of suggested fixes compile/run successfully
   - 80%+ of fixes effectively resolve vulnerabilities
   - Clear, actionable remediation steps

4. **Compliance Coverage**
   - Support for major compliance frameworks
   - Automated compliance report generation
   - Audit trail maintenance

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Technical Risks**
   - Complex vulnerability patterns may be missed
   - Mitigation: Continuous pattern library updates

2. **Performance Risks**
   - Large codebases may cause timeouts
   - Mitigation: Implement incremental scanning

3. **Integration Risks**
   - Third-party tool compatibility issues
   - Mitigation: Build abstraction layers

4. **Adoption Risks**
   - Developer resistance to security findings
   - Mitigation: Focus on actionable, low-noise reporting
