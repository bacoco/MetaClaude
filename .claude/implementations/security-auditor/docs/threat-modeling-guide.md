# Threat Modeling Guide

## Introduction

Threat modeling is a structured approach to identifying, assessing, and addressing potential security threats to a system. This guide provides a comprehensive framework for conducting effective threat modeling exercises that integrate seamlessly with the Security Auditor's capabilities.

## Threat Modeling Methodologies

### STRIDE

STRIDE is Microsoft's threat modeling methodology that categorizes threats into six types:

#### Spoofing Identity
- **Definition**: Illegally accessing and using another user's authentication information
- **Examples**:
  - Stolen credentials
  - Session hijacking
  - Man-in-the-middle attacks
- **Mitigations**:
  - Strong authentication mechanisms
  - Multi-factor authentication
  - Certificate pinning

#### Tampering with Data
- **Definition**: Malicious modification of data
- **Examples**:
  - SQL injection
  - Parameter manipulation
  - File system attacks
- **Mitigations**:
  - Input validation
  - Integrity checks
  - Digital signatures

#### Repudiation
- **Definition**: Users denying actions without proof of the contrary
- **Examples**:
  - Claiming not to have performed a transaction
  - Denying receipt of information
- **Mitigations**:
  - Comprehensive audit logging
  - Digital signatures
  - Timestamps

#### Information Disclosure
- **Definition**: Exposing information to unauthorized individuals
- **Examples**:
  - Data breaches
  - Verbose error messages
  - Unencrypted data transmission
- **Mitigations**:
  - Encryption at rest and in transit
  - Access controls
  - Data classification

#### Denial of Service
- **Definition**: Making a system unavailable to legitimate users
- **Examples**:
  - Resource exhaustion
  - Distributed attacks
  - Logic bombs
- **Mitigations**:
  - Rate limiting
  - Resource allocation
  - Redundancy

#### Elevation of Privilege
- **Definition**: Gaining unauthorized access to privileged resources
- **Examples**:
  - Privilege escalation
  - Buffer overflows
  - Improper authorization
- **Mitigations**:
  - Principle of least privilege
  - Input validation
  - Secure coding practices

### Threat Actor
- **Type**: External Attacker
- **Motivation**: Financial Gain
- **Capability**: Intermediate

### Attack Vector
- **Entry Point**: Login Form
- **Vulnerability**: Unsanitized Input
- **Technique**: SQL Injection

### Attack Steps

## Best Practices

### Do's
- Start threat modeling early in the development lifecycle
- Involve all stakeholders (developers, architects, security, business)
- Focus on the most critical assets and likely threats
- Keep threat models updated as the system evolves
- Use threat modeling to drive security requirements
- Validate threat models through testing

### Don'ts
- Don't try to model every possible threat
- Don't work in isolation - threat modeling is a team activity
- Don't ignore business context
- Don't treat threat models as one-time exercises
- Don't overcomplicate the process
- Don't skip the mitigation planning phase

## Conclusion

Effective threat modeling is an essential component of a comprehensive security program. By following this guide and leveraging the Security Auditor's automated capabilities, organizations can systematically identify and address security threats before they can be exploited.

Remember that threat modeling is an iterative process that should evolve with your system and the threat landscape. Regular reviews and updates ensure that your security posture remains strong against emerging threats.
