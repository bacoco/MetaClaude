# Tool Builder Development Plan

**Goal:** Enable MetaClaude to dynamically create, integrate, and manage new tools based on identified needs.

## Phase 1: Core Definition & Design (2-4 weeks)

### Objectives
- **Detailed Requirements:** Define precise input/output for tool requests (e.g., desired function, input parameters, expected output format, target language/environment)
- **Agent Design:** Refine roles of Tool Requirements Analyst, Tool Design Architect, Tool Code Generator, Tool Integrator, Tool Validator
- **Core Workflows:** Map out the "Dynamic Tool Creation" workflow (Request -> Analyze -> Design -> Generate Code -> Integrate -> Validate)
- **"Hiik" Integration Strategy:** Design the internal mechanisms (e.g., API calls, file system interactions) that the Tool Builder will use to manifest and register tools
- **Initial Tool Templates:** Create basic templates for common tool types (e.g., simple Python script, shell command wrapper)

### Deliverables
- [ ] Complete agent role specifications
- [ ] Workflow documentation and diagrams
- [ ] Integration mechanism design
- [ ] Basic tool templates library

## Phase 2: Prototype & Basic Functionality (4-8 weeks)

### Objectives
- **Minimal Tool Generation:** Implement the ability to generate very simple tools (e.g., a tool that executes a predefined shell command with dynamic arguments)
- **Basic Integration:** Develop the mechanism to add new tool definitions to `tool-usage-matrix.md` programmatically
- **Validation Loop:** Implement a basic self-validation step for generated tools (e.g., running a simple test against the generated tool)

### Deliverables
- [ ] Working prototype of tool generation system
- [ ] Automated tool registration mechanism
- [ ] Basic validation framework
- [ ] Initial test suite

## Phase 3: Advanced Tooling & Adaptive Learning (8-12 weeks)

### Objectives
- **Complex Tool Generation:** Extend capabilities to generate more complex tools (e.g., API wrappers, simple data processing scripts)
- **Adaptive Tool Design:** Implement feedback loops for the Tool Builder to learn from successful/failed tool creations
- **Proactive Tool Suggestion:** Enhance `tool-suggestion-patterns.md` to allow the Tool Builder to suggest tool creation when it identifies recurring manual steps
- **Error Handling & Debugging:** Implement robust error reporting and debugging capabilities for tool generation failures

### Deliverables
- [ ] Advanced tool generation capabilities
- [ ] Learning and adaptation system
- [ ] Proactive suggestion mechanism
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling

## Phase 4: Testing & Hardening (4 weeks)

### Objectives
- **Comprehensive Testing:** Test tool generation across various scenarios, languages, and complexities
- **Security Audit:** Ensure generated tools adhere to security best practices and don't introduce vulnerabilities
- **Performance Benchmarking:** Evaluate the efficiency of the tool generation process

### Deliverables
- [ ] Complete test coverage report
- [ ] Security audit results and fixes
- [ ] Performance benchmarks and optimizations
- [ ] Bug fixes and stability improvements

## Phase 5: Documentation & Release (2 weeks)

### Objectives
- **User Guide:** Document how other specialists can request new tools
- **Developer Guide:** Document the internal workings of the Tool Builder for future enhancements

### Deliverables
- [ ] User documentation
- [ ] Developer documentation
- [ ] API reference
- [ ] Release notes

## Success Metrics

- Number of tools successfully generated and integrated
- Time from tool request to deployment
- Tool reliability and test pass rates
- Agent adoption rate of newly generated tools
- Reduction in manual tool creation tasks

## Risk Mitigation

- **Security Risks:** Implement sandboxing and code review mechanisms
- **Integration Complexity:** Start with simple tools and gradually increase complexity
- **Performance Impact:** Monitor resource usage and implement caching strategies
- **Tool Quality:** Establish minimum quality standards and automated testing
