# User Story Mapping Workflow

## Overview
The User Story Mapping workflow transforms validated requirements into a structured hierarchy of user stories, creating a visual narrative of the user journey and organizing features for iterative development.

## Workflow Stages

### Stage 1: Preparation and Setup

   - Define user goals
   - Map user journeys

2. **Mapping Framework Setup**
   ```
   User Story Map Structure:
   
   ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
   │           User Activities (Backbone)         │
   ├─────────────┬─────────────┬─────────────────┤
   │   Task 1    │   Task 2    │     Task 3      │
   ├─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────────┤
   │  Story 1.1  │  Story 2.1  │   Story 3.1     │
   │  Story 1.2  │  Story 2.2  │   Story 3.2     │
   │  Story 1.3  │  Story 2.3  │   Story 3.3     │
   └─────────────┴─────────────┴─────────────────┘
   ```

#### Story Creation Process

1. **Requirement to Story Transformation**
   ```markdown
   Requirement: "Users must be able to search products by multiple criteria"
   
   Generated Stories:
   - As a shopper, I want to search by product name so that I can quickly find specific items
   - As a shopper, I want to filter by category so that I can narrow down my options
   - As a shopper, I want to filter by price range so that I can find products within my budget
   - As a shopper, I want to combine filters so that I can refine my search results
   ```

2. **Story Sizing and Slicing**
   ```yaml
   Story Slicing Patterns:
   - By user type (guest vs registered)
   - By data type (simple vs complex)
   - By business rule (basic vs advanced)
   - By UI complexity (mobile vs desktop)
   - By happy path vs edge cases
   ```

3. **Dependency Identification**
   ```mermaid
   graph TD
     A[User Registration] --> B[User Login]
     B --> C[Save Preferences]
     B --> D[View Order History]
     C --> E[Personalized Recommendations]
