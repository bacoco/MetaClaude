# Product Management Methodologies

## Overview
This document covers various product management methodologies and frameworks that can be applied when creating PRDs, managing requirements, and developing products.

## 1. Agile Methodologies

### Scrum Framework

#### Core Components
```markdown
Roles:
- Product Owner: Owns the product backlog
- Scrum Master: Facilitates the process
- Development Team: Builds the product

Artifacts:
- Product Backlog: Prioritized list of features
- Sprint Backlog: Items for current sprint
- Product Increment: Working product

Events:
- Sprint Planning: Define sprint goals
- Daily Scrum: Sync on progress
- Sprint Review: Demo completed work
- Sprint Retrospective: Improve process
```

#### PRD in Scrum
- Living document updated each sprint
- Epics broken into user stories
- Continuous refinement and prioritization
- Close collaboration with development team

### Kanban Method

#### Key Principles
1. **Visualize Work**: Use boards to show workflow
2. **Limit WIP**: Control work in progress
3. **Manage Flow**: Optimize throughput
4. **Make Policies Explicit**: Clear rules
5. **Continuous Improvement**: Regular optimization

#### PRD in Kanban
```markdown
Continuous Flow Approach:
- Requirements added as needed
- No fixed iterations
- Priority changes allowed
- Focus on cycle time
- Just-in-time refinement
```

### SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework)

#### Levels of Requirements
```markdown
Portfolio Level:
- Strategic Themes
- Epics
- Value Streams

Program Level:
- Features
- Program Backlog
- Release Trains

Team Level:
- User Stories
- Team Backlog
- Iterations
```

#### PRD in SAFe
- Aligned with strategic themes
- Features mapped to epics
- Coordinated across teams
- Regular PI (Program Increment) planning

## 2. Traditional Methodologies

### Waterfall Approach

#### Phases
```markdown
1. Requirements → Complete PRD
2. Design → Technical specifications
3. Implementation → Development
4. Testing → Quality assurance
5. Deployment → Release
6. Maintenance → Support
```

#### PRD in Waterfall
- Comprehensive upfront documentation
- Detailed requirements before design
- Sign-offs at each phase
- Changes require formal process
- Best for stable, well-understood domains

### Stage-Gate Process

#### Gates and Criteria
```markdown
Gate 1: Idea Screening
- Strategic fit
- Market potential
- Technical feasibility

Gate 2: Business Case
- Detailed market analysis
- Financial projections
- Resource requirements

Gate 3: Development
- Prototype results
- Technical validation
- Updated projections

Gate 4: Testing
- Market test results
- Production readiness
- Launch preparation

Gate 5: Launch
- Full market release
- Performance monitoring
- Optimization
```

## 3. Lean Methodologies

### Lean Product Development

#### Core Principles
1. **Eliminate Waste**: Remove non-value activities
2. **Build Quality In**: Prevent defects
3. **Create Knowledge**: Learn continuously
4. **Defer Commitment**: Decide at last responsible moment
5. **Deliver Fast**: Short cycle times
6. **Respect People**: Empower teams
7. **Optimize the Whole**: System thinking

#### Build-Measure-Learn Cycle
```markdown
Build:
- Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
- Quick prototypes
- Focused experiments

Measure:
- User behavior
- Key metrics
- Feedback collection

Learn:
- Validate hypotheses
- Pivot or persevere
- Update requirements
```

### Lean Canvas

#### One-Page Business Model
```markdown
┌─────────────────┬─────────────────┬─────────────────┬─────────────────┬─────────────────┐
│ Problem         │ Solution        │ Key Metrics     │ Unique Value    │ Unfair          │
│                 │                 │                 │ Proposition     │ Advantage       │
├─────────────────┼─────────────────┤                 ├─────────────────┼─────────────────┤
│ Customer        │ Channels        │                 │ Customer        │ Cost Structure  │
│ Segments        │                 │                 │ Relationships   │                 │
├─────────────────┴─────────────────┴─────────────────┴─────────────────┼─────────────────┤
│ Revenue Streams                                                         │                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┴─────────────────┘
```

## 4. User-Centered Methodologies

### Design Thinking

#### Five Phases
```markdown
1. Empathize
   - User interviews
   - Observation
   - Persona development

2. Define
   - Problem statements
   - User needs
   - Design challenges

3. Ideate
   - Brainstorming
   - Concept development
   - Solution exploration

4. Prototype
   - Low-fi mockups
   - Interactive demos
   - Quick iterations

5. Test
   - User testing
   - Feedback collection
   - Iteration
```

### Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD)

#### Framework Structure
```markdown
When [situation]
I want to [motivation]
So I can [expected outcome]

Example:
When I'm planning a trip
I want to compare flight prices easily
So I can book within my budget quickly
```

#### JTBD in PRDs
- Focus on outcomes, not features
- Understand context and circumstances
- Define success metrics around job completion
- Prioritize based on job importance

### User Story Mapping

#### Mapping Structure
```markdown
User Activities (Backbone)
├── User Tasks
│   ├── User Stories (Release 1)
│   ├── User Stories (Release 2)
│   └── User Stories (Future)
```

#### Benefits for PRDs
- Visual representation of user journey
- Clear prioritization by releases
- Identifies gaps in functionality
- Facilitates stakeholder communication

## 5. Hybrid Approaches

### Spotify Model

#### Structure
```markdown
Squads:
- Self-organizing teams
- Own feature area
- Mini startups

Tribes:
- Collection of squads
- Common mission
- <100 people

Chapters:
- Skill-based groups
- Cross-squad
- Knowledge sharing

Guilds:
- Interest groups
- Voluntary
- Best practices
```

### Dual-Track Agile

#### Two Parallel Tracks
```markdown
Discovery Track:
- User research
- Problem validation
- Solution exploration
- Prototyping

Delivery Track:
- Sprint planning
- Development
- Testing
- Release
```

#### PRD Management
- Continuous discovery feeds delivery
- Requirements validated before development
- Reduced rework and waste
- Better product-market fit

## 6. Prioritization Frameworks

### RICE Scoring

#### Formula
```markdown
RICE Score = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort

Where:
- Reach: Users affected per time period
- Impact: 3=Massive, 2=High, 1=Medium, 0.5=Low, 0.25=Minimal
- Confidence: 100%=High, 80%=Medium, 50%=Low
- Effort: Person-months
```

### Value vs Effort Matrix

```markdown
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ High Value  │ Quick Wins        │
│ High Effort │ (Do First)        │
├─────────────┼───────────────────┤
│ Major       │ Fill-ins          │
│ Projects    │ (Do Last)         │
│ (Do Second) │                   │
└─────────────┴───────────────────┘
  High Effort    Low Effort
```

### Kano Model

#### Feature Categories
1. **Must-Be**: Basic expectations
2. **One-Dimensional**: Linear satisfaction
3. **Attractive**: Delighters
4. **Indifferent**: No impact
5. **Reverse**: Negative impact

### MoSCoW Method

```markdown
Must Have (60%):
- Critical for launch
- Regulatory requirements
- Core functionality

Should Have (20%):
- Important but not critical
- Can work around temporarily

Could Have (20%):
- Nice to have
- Improves experience

Won't Have:
- Out of scope
- Future consideration
```
