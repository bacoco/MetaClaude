## Getting Started

1. Review the [Development Plan](development-plan.md) for implementation phases
2. Explore agent capabilities in the [agents/](agents/) directory
3. Use workflow templates from [workflows/](workflows/)
4. Access IaC templates in [iac-templates/](iac-templates/)
5. Find pipeline templates in [pipeline-templates/](pipeline-templates/)

## Integration Points

## Success Metrics

- **Deployment Frequency**: Track deployments per day/week
- **Lead Time**: Measure time from commit to production
- **MTTR**: Mean time to recovery from incidents
- **Change Failure Rate**: Percentage of deployments causing failures
- **Infrastructure Cost**: Cloud spend optimization metrics

## Integration with Other Specialists

The DevOps Engineer bridges the gap between development and operations, ensuring smooth deployment and operation of systems designed by other specialists:

### Key Integration: DevOps Engineer ↔ Code Architect
This bidirectional relationship ensures seamless transition from design to deployment:

```yaml
Architecture → Infrastructure:
- Microservice design → Container orchestration setup
- Database requirements → RDS/Cloud SQL provisioning
- API Gateway specs → Load balancer configuration
- Caching strategy → Redis/Memcached deployment

Infrastructure → Architecture:
- Performance metrics → Architecture optimization
- Cost analysis → Resource-efficient design
- Scaling patterns → Architecture adjustments
- Incident data → Resilience improvements
```

### Integration Patterns

**← Tool Builder**
- Requests deployment automation tools
- Needs infrastructure testing utilities
- Requires monitoring integration tools
- Uses cost optimization analyzers

- Receives architectural specifications
- Gets deployment requirements
- Implements infrastructure for designs
- Provides operational feedback

**→ QA Engineer**
- Sets up test environments
- Provides CI/CD test integration
- Manages test data infrastructure
- Enables performance testing platforms

**← Data Scientist**
- Deploys ML model serving infrastructure
- Sets up data pipeline environments
- Manages GPU/TPU resources
- Implements A/B testing infrastructure

**← PRD Specialist**
