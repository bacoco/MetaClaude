# MetaClaude Coordination Layer Implementation

## Implementation Summary

The Enhanced Coordination layer for MetaClaude hooks has been successfully implemented with the following components:

### 1. Real-Time Agent Communication Layer

**Files:**
- `broadcast.sh` - PostToolUse hook for broadcasting messages
- `subscribe.sh` - Agent subscription management

**Features:**
- Topic-based pub-sub messaging system
- Message queuing with persistence
- Non-blocking message delivery
- Automatic cleanup of old messages
- Support for filtered subscriptions

**Topics:** system, task, state, conflict, coordination

### 2. Shared State Management

**Files:**
- `state-manager.sh` - Atomic state operations with locking
- `state-sync.sh` - State synchronization with vector clocks

**Features:**
- Atomic get/set/update/delete operations
- Lock-based concurrency control
- State snapshots and restoration
- Journal logging for audit trail
- Vector clock-based conflict detection
- Automatic conflict resolution strategies

### 3. Conflict Detection and Resolution

**Files:**
- `detect-conflicts.sh` - PostToolUse hook for conflict detection
- `resolve-conflicts.sh` - Automated conflict resolution

**Features:**
- Resource contention detection (files, directories, services)
- Task assignment conflict detection
- Agent priority hierarchy (orchestrator > architect > reviewer > etc.)
- Multiple resolution strategies (priority-based, sequential, merge, block)
- Automatic and manual resolution modes
- Conflict monitoring and alerting

### 4. Orchestration vs Execution Enforcement

**Files:**
- `role-enforcer.sh` - PreToolUse hook for role boundary enforcement

**Features:**
- Agent role definitions (orchestration, execution, analysis)
- Tool permission matrix per role
- Delegation requirement detection
- Violation tracking and reporting
- Delegation suggestions
- Pattern analysis for compliance

### 5. Hook Integration

**Added to `.claude/settings.json`:**

**PreToolUse:**
- `metaclaude-role-enforcement` - Enforces agent role boundaries

**PostToolUse:**
- `metaclaude-broadcast-system` - Broadcasts tool usage
- `metaclaude-conflict-detection` - Detects resource conflicts

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Communication Architecture
- Chose pub-sub over direct messaging for scalability
- Topic-based filtering reduces message noise
- File-based queues for simplicity and persistence

### 2. State Management
- Vector clocks for distributed consistency
- Optimistic locking with conflict detection
- Namespace isolation for different concerns

### 3. Conflict Resolution
- Rule-based automatic resolution
- Agent hierarchy for priority decisions
- Manual override capability for complex cases

### 4. Role Enforcement
- Strict separation of orchestration and execution
- Tool-based permission model
- Proactive delegation suggestions

## Usage Examples

### Multi-Agent Coordination Flow

```bash
# 1. Orchestrator creates task
AGENT_TYPE=orchestrator AGENT_ID=orch_001
./role-enforcer.sh  # Validates orchestrator can use Task tool

# 2. Orchestrator delegates to coder
TOOL_NAME=Task TOOL_OUTPUT='{"agent": "coder", "task": "implement feature"}'
./broadcast.sh  # Broadcasts delegation

# 3. Coder subscribes and receives task
AGENT_TYPE=coder AGENT_ID=coder_001
./subscribe.sh create coder_001 coder "coordination"
./subscribe.sh read coder_001

# 4. Coder claims file resource
./detect-conflicts.sh claim file "app.js" coder_001 modify

# 5. Another agent tries to modify same file
AGENT_ID=coder_002
./detect-conflicts.sh claim file "app.js" coder_002 modify
# Conflict detected!

# 6. Automatic resolution based on rules
./resolve-conflicts.sh resolve-all auto
```

### State Synchronization Example

```bash
# Multiple agents updating shared state
AGENT_ID=agent_001 ./state-sync.sh sync main task_list '["task1", "task2"]'
AGENT_ID=agent_002 ./state-sync.sh sync main task_list '["task1", "task3"]'

# Process synchronization
./state-sync.sh process main
# Result: Merged list ["task1", "task2", "task3"]
```

## Testing

Run the comprehensive test suite:

```bash
cd .claude/hooks/metaclaude/coordination
./test-coordination.sh
```

## Performance Considerations

1. **Message Volume** - Use specific topics to reduce broadcast traffic
2. **State Size** - Partition large state into namespaces
3. **Lock Duration** - Set appropriate timeouts for resource claims
4. **Cleanup** - Regular cleanup jobs prevent accumulation

## Security Notes

1. Agent IDs should be validated in production
2. State namespaces provide isolation
3. Resource limits prevent denial of service
4. Message content should be validated

## Future Enhancements

1. **Encryption** - Add message encryption for sensitive data
2. **Replication** - Distributed state replication
3. **ML Integration** - Predict conflicts before they occur
4. **Dynamic Roles** - Adjust roles based on workload
5. **REST API** - HTTP interface for external integration

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Permission Denied" errors**
   - Ensure scripts are executable: `chmod +x *.sh`

2. **"Lock timeout" errors**
   - Increase timeout or check for stale locks
   - Run cleanup: `./detect-conflicts.sh cleanup 0`

3. **"Vector clock mismatch"**
   - Indicates concurrent modifications
   - Check conflict resolution logs

4. **"Role violation" warnings**
   - Review agent type and attempted operation
   - Consider delegation to appropriate agent

## Monitoring

Key metrics to monitor:
- Broadcast message rate
- Active conflicts count
- Role violations per agent
- State update frequency
- Resource contention hotspots

## Conclusion

The Enhanced Coordination layer provides a robust foundation for multi-agent collaboration with:
- Clear communication channels
- Consistent shared state
- Automatic conflict resolution
- Enforced role boundaries

This enables complex multi-agent workflows while maintaining system integrity and preventing conflicts.
